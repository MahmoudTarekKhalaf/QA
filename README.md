# Quantum annealing
These are basic programs that have been written while attempting to understand Ocean software. 
Besides these apps, we have fully explored programs for clustering, scheduling, map coloring, and prime factoraization.
Note: Install ocean-dwavesys to be able to run these docs.
##Docs: 
1. factoring21
This is a basic code to factor 21 after getting its BQM using mathematica.
2.pattern
Detecting any repetitive pattern in a set of consecutive binary numbers based on sub-patterns of length 3. 
3.poly_pattern
Detecting any repetitive pattern in a set of consecutive binary numbers based on sub-patterns of length 5 by using the poly composite solver.
4. OneHotPotentialEncoding
Encoding a potential on a BQM using the method proposed by the paper "Quantum Computing for Quantum Tunnelling".
